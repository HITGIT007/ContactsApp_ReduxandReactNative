The mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps deals with your Redux storeâ€™s state and
 dispatch, respectively. state and dispatch will be supplied to your mapStateToProps
  or mapDispatchToProps functions as the first argument.
The returns of mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps are referred to internally as
 stateProps and dispatchProps, respectively. They will be supplied to mergeProps, 
 if defined, as the first and the second argument, where the third argument will be 
 ownProps. The combined result, commonly referred to as mergedProps, 
 will then be supplied to your connected component.
